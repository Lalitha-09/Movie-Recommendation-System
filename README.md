# Movie-Recommendation-System

*Recommendation System*

>A recommendation system is a subclass of Information filtering Systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item. In simple words,  it is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to users. Eg: In the case of Netflix which movie to watch, In the case of e-commerce which product to buy, or In the    case of kindle which book to read, etc.

>Recommendation System is of two types: <br/>

a) Content Based Recommendation <br/>
b) Collaborative Filtering.

> Developed a content based movie recommendation engine.It uses the attributes or features of an item  (this is the content part) to recommend other items similar to the user’s preferences. This approach is based on similarity of item and user features,  given information about a user and items they have interacted with (e.g. a user’s age, the category of a restaurant’s cuisine, the average review for a movie),  model the likelihood of a new interaction. 

> It gives recommendations mainly based on the director name, the actor name, movie genre, and the movie title.If any user searches for a comedy film,from then on he would get comedy movies as the recommendations.
