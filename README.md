## Recommendation System <br/>

>A recommendation system is a subclass of Information filtering Systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item. In simple words,  it is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to users. Eg: In the case of Netflix which movie to watch, In the case of e-commerce which product to buy, or In the    case of kindle which book to read, etc.

### Recommendation System is of two types: <br/>

a) Content Based Recommendation <br/>
b) Collaborative Filtering.

> Developed a content based movie recommendation engine.It uses the attributes or features of an item  (this is the content part) to recommend other items similar to the userâ€™s preferences. This approach is based on similarity of item and user features,  given information about a user and items they have interacted with.

> It gives recommendations mainly based on the director name, the actor name, movie genre, and the movie title.If any user searches for a comedy film,from then on he would get comedy movies as the recommendations.

## Vectorization <br/>
Vectorization is a classic approach of converting input data from its raw format text into vectors of real numbers which is the format that Machine Learning models support. 
> Used TF-IDF vectorizer for the vectorization. <br/>

## TF-IDF Vectorizer  <br/>
Term frequency-inverse document frequency is a text vectorizer that transforms the text into a usable vector. It combines 2 concepts, Term Frequency (TF) and Document Frequency (DF).

### Term Frequency (TF) <br/>
Term frequency is defined as the number of times a word appears in a document divided by the total number of words in the document.  <br/>
